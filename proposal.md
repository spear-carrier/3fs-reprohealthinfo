# Fear, Friction, and Flooding in Reproductive Healthcare Information Sources Online - A Class Project for Internet Censorship and Online Speech (Winter 2024)

Matt Ryan cnetid: mattryan

I'd like to work alone on this - as I'm missing some of the class meetings, live far from campus, have 2 young kids, etc. From what I understood in lecture, solo projects are fine - please let me know if this won't fly. 

## Project Summary

5 paragraphs

A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. If you follow a simple set of rules, you can write a very good introduction. The following outline can be varied. For example, you can use two paragraphs instead of one, or you can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. But in all cases, all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, and in most papers, you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.

Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger community?

Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you establish specific context and background.

Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that ...". This is the key paragraph in the intro - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main contributions of your paper given the context you have established in paragraphs 1 and 2. What is the general approach taken? Why are the specific results significant? This paragraph must be really really good. If you can't "sell" your work at a high level in a paragraph in the intro, then you are in trouble. As a reader or reviewer, this is the paragraph that I always look for, and read very carefully.

You should think about how to structure this one or two paragraph summary of what your paper is all about. If there are two or three main results, then you might consider itemizing them with bullets or in test (e.g., "First, ..."). If the results fall broadly into two categories, you can bring out that distinction here. For example, "Our results are both theoretical and applied in nature. (two sentences follow, one each on theory and application)"

Paragraph 4: At a high level what are the differences in what you are doing, and what others have done? Keep this at a high level, you can refer to a future section where specific details and differences will be given. But it is important for the reader to know at a high level, what is new about this work compared to other work in the area.

Paragraph 5: "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows..." Give the reader a roadmap for the rest of the paper. Avoid redundant phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ... In Section 4, ... " etc.

-   Think of this as a draft of your project report introduction.

    introduction](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/kurose/writing/intro-style.html)
-   What is the problem?
-   Why is it an important problem? (Provide citations if possible to
    support your claims of relevance. Examples could be previous
    work/research papers, news stories, anecdotes, software packages,
    etc.)
-   What kinds of actions could be taken based on your results, and who
    is equipped to take those actions? 


## Related Work

-   Draft as much as you can of your related work section.
-   Organize your related work so it is more than just a "list". 
    Organize thematically; look at related work sections from other
    published papers for examples.
-   Include all references (e.g., as bibtex) so your related work is as
    complete as possible for now.
-   Also articulate *how your work extends* the related work you cite.

## Project Preparation and Prerequisites 

-   What do you need to complete this project?
-   If your project is measurement based, describe the data you have and
    the data you'll need to collect, as well as results you might expect
    and how you would present them
-   If your project is to build a system (e.g., censorship circumvention
    tool), describe how you may go about doing that (will you extend an
    existing software code base, for example)?

## Evaluation

-   This of this as a starting point for the project.
-   Describe your evaluation process? Be as specific as possible about
    your evaluation techniques

## Ethics

-   Briefly discuss the ethical implications of your work. Will your
    models suffer from any kind of bias? Will this potential bias impact
    the fairness of any proposed solutions?
