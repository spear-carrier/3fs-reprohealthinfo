# Fear, Friction, and Flooding in United States Reproductive Healthcare Information Sources Online - A Class Project for Internet Censorship and Online Speech (Winter 2024)

Matt Ryan cnetid: mattryan

I'd like to work alone on this - as I'm missing some of the class meetings, live far from campus, have 2 young kids, etc. From what I understood in lecture, solo projects are fine - please let me know if this won't fly. 

## Summary

-   Think of this as a draft of your project report introduction.
    Advice on [writing a good
    introduction](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/kurose/writing/intro-style.html)
-   What is the problem?
-   Why is it an important problem? (Provide citations if possible to
    support your claims of relevance. Examples could be previous
    work/research papers, news stories, anecdotes, software packages,
    etc.)
-   What kinds of actions could be taken based on your results, and who
    is equipped to take those actions? 


## Related Work

-   Draft as much as you can of your related work section.
-   Organize your related work so it is more than just a "list". 
    Organize thematically; look at related work sections from other
    published papers for examples.
-   Include all references (e.g., as bibtex) so your related work is as
    complete as possible for now.
-   Also articulate *how your work extends* the related work you cite.

## Project Preparation and Prerequisites 

-   What do you need to complete this project?
-   If your project is measurement based, describe the data you have and
    the data you'll need to collect, as well as results you might expect
    and how you would present them
-   If your project is to build a system (e.g., censorship circumvention
    tool), describe how you may go about doing that (will you extend an
    existing software code base, for example)?

## Evaluation

-   This of this as a starting point for the project.
-   Describe your evaluation process? Be as specific as possible about
    your evaluation techniques

## Ethics

-   Briefly discuss the ethical implications of your work. Will your
    models suffer from any kind of bias? Will this potential bias impact
    the fairness of any proposed solutions?
